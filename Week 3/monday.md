# Day 1: Interactive Story Project

## Objective
Create a simple interactive story with multiple backdrops and sprites using Scratch 3.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. Start a New Project
   - Open [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/) and click "Create" to start a new project.
   - Right-click on the cat sprite in the Sprite Pane and select "delete" to remove it.

2. Create the First Backdrop
   - Click "Choose a Backdrop" in the bottom right of the Stage Pane.
   - Select a backdrop for your first scene from the Backdrop Library.

3. Add Sprites
   - Click "Choose a Sprite" in the bottom right of the Sprite Pane.
   - Select at least two sprites for your story from the Sprite Library.

4. Program the First Sprite
   - Select your first sprite in the Sprite Pane.
   - In the Code area, add these blocks:
     - "when green flag clicked" (from Events category)
     - "say [Hello!] for (2) seconds" (from Looks category)

5. Add Interaction
   - Add these blocks to your sprite:
     - "when [space v] key pressed" (from Events category)
     - "say [What's your name?]" (from Looks category)
     - "ask [What's your name?] and wait" (from Sensing category)
     - "say (join [Nice to meet you, ] (answer))" (from Looks category)

6. Create Multiple Backdrops
   - Click "Choose a Backdrop" to add a new backdrop to the Stage.
   - Add these blocks to your first sprite:
     - "when [right arrow v] key pressed" (from Events category)
     - "switch backdrop to [your new backdrop v]" (from Looks category)
     - "say [We've arrived at the new location!]" (from Looks category)

7. Program the Second Sprite
   - Select your second sprite in the Sprite Pane.
   - Add these blocks:
     - "when backdrop switches to [your new backdrop v]" (from Events category)
     - "show" (from Looks category)
     - "say [Welcome to my home!]" (from Looks category)

8. Add Sound
   - Click the Sounds tab for one of your sprites.
   - Click "Choose a Sound" to add a sound from the Sound Library or record your own.
   - In the Code area, add a "play sound [your chosen sound v]" block (from Sound category) where appropriate in your story.

9. Test and Debug
   - Click the green flag to start your story.
   - Test all interactions and fix any issues.

10. Extend the Story (Optional)
    - Add more backdrops and sprites following the same process.
    - Use different events (like "when this sprite clicked") to trigger story progression.
    - Use "if then" blocks (from Control category) to create branching paths based on user input.

Remember to save your project regularly by clicking "File" then "Save now" in the top menu.
