# Python Lesson 1: Say Hello to Print and Variables!

## Let's Get Started
We'll use a special website to write our Python code. [Click here to open it](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/online-compiler/)

## What We'll Learn Today
After this lesson, you'll know how to:
1. Use `print()` to show words on the screen
2. Make variables to store information

## Part 1: The Print Function

In Python, we use `print()` to show words on the screen. It's like telling the computer to speak! Here's how it looks:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

This will show: Hello, Python!

You can put any words between the quotation marks, and Python will show them.

### Your Turn:
1. Use `print()` to show your name.
2. Use `print()` to show the name of your favorite animal.

## Part 2: Variables

Variables are like magic boxes that hold information. We give them names and put stuff inside them.

To make a variable, we use a name, an equal sign, and what we want to put in it:

```python
age = 10
name = "Alex"
```

Then we can use these variables in our code:

```python
print(name)
print(age)
```

This will show:
Alex
10

### Your Turn:
1. Make a variable called `favorite_color` and put your favorite color in it.
2. Make a variable called `hobby` and put your favorite hobby in it.
3. Use `print()` to show both variables.

## Let's Make: All About Me!

Let's use print and variables to make a program all about you!

1. Make variables for your name, age, and favorite color.
2. Use `print()` and your variables to show three sentences about yourself.

Here's an example:
```python
name = "Sam"
age = 11
favorite_color = "green"

print("My name is " + name + ".")
print("I am " + str(age) + " years old.")
print("My favorite color is " + favorite_color + ".")
```

Now, make your own "All About Me" program!

## Great Job!
You've finished your first Python lesson! You learned how to use `print()` to show words and how to make variables. Next time, we'll learn more cool things to do with variables!
