
# Playdough Percussion: Turn Dough into Music with Makey Makey!

## Day 1: Meet Makey Makey

### What You'll Need
- Makey Makey kit
- Computer with internet access
- Alligator clips
- Playdough

### Let's Get Started!

#### 1. What is Makey Makey?

Makey Makey is a cool invention kit that lets you turn objects into computer keys. Today, we'll use it to make music with playdough!

- Look at your Makey Makey kit. Can you find these parts?
  - The circuit board (the green, computer-like thing)
  - Alligator clips (wires with "jaws" at the ends)
  - USB cable (to connect to your computer)

#### 2. How Does It Work?

Makey Makey works by completing an electrical circuit. When you touch the playdough, you're closing a circuit, which sends a signal to the computer.

Let's test it out:

1. Connect your Makey Makey to the computer using the USB cable.
2. Attach one end of an alligator clip to "Earth" on the Makey Makey.
3. Hold the metal part of this "Earth" clip with one hand.
4. With your other hand, touch the metal part of another alligator clip connected to "Space" on the Makey Makey.
5. Did you see the light on the Makey Makey flash? You just acted like a human keyboard!

#### 3. Playdough Power: Conducting Electricity

Playdough is great at conducting electricity! This means it lets electricity flow through it easily.

Let's see it in action:

1. Keep one hand on the "Earth" clip.
2. Connect another alligator clip to "Space" on the Makey Makey.
3. Touch the free end of this clip to your playdough.
4. The Makey Makey should light up, showing that playdough conducts electricity.

#### 4. Playdough Bongos Time!

Now, let's make some music with our playdough:

1. Go to this [Banana Bongos link](https://makeymakey.com/blogs/how-to-instructions/first-time-demo-makey-makey-banana-bongos)
2. Shape two pieces of playdough into "bongos" on your desk.
3. Connect the "Earth" clip to a third piece of playdough - this will be your ground.
4. Connect one alligator clip from "Space" on the Makey Makey to one playdough bongo.
5. Connect another alligator clip from "Click" on the Makey Makey to the other playdough bongo.
6. Place one finger on the ground playdough, and use your other hand to tap the bongos.
7. Listen to the beats you create!

### Challenge:

Can you create a cool rhythm using your playdough bongos? Try reshaping your playdough or adding more to create different sounds!

Remember, the fun of Makey Makey is in experimenting. Don't be afraid to try new things with your playdough. Enjoy your playdough percussion adventure!
