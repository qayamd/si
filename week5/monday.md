# Makey Makey Adventure: Turn the World into a Computer! 

## Day 1: Meet Makey Makey

### What You'll Need
- Makey Makey kit
- Computer with internet access
- Alligator clips
- Different objects to test (fruits, aluminum foil, paper, plastic, etc.)

### Let's Get Started!

#### 1. What is Makey Makey?
Makey Makey is a cool invention kit that lets you turn everyday objects into computer keys. It's like magic, but it's actually science!

- Look at your Makey Makey kit. Can you find these parts?
  - The circuit board (it looks like a little green computer)
  - Alligator clips (wires with "mouths" at the ends)
  - USB cable (to connect to your computer)

#### 2. How Does It Work?
Makey Makey works by completing an electrical circuit. When you touch the right objects, you're closing a circuit, which sends a signal to the computer.

Let's test it out:
1. Connect your Makey Makey to the computer using the USB cable.
2. Attach one end of an alligator clip to "Earth" on the Makey Makey.
3. Hold the metal part of this "Earth" clip with one hand.
4. With your other hand, touch the metal part of another alligator clip connected to "Space" on the Makey Makey.
5. Did you see the light on the Makey Makey flash? You just acted like a human keyboard!

#### 3. What Conducts Electricity? 
Some materials let electricity flow through them easily. We call these "conductors." Others don't let electricity flow well. We call these "insulators."

Let's experiment:
1. Keep one hand on the "Earth" clip.
2. Connect another alligator clip to "Space" on the Makey Makey.
3. Touch the free end of this clip to different objects.
4. If the Makey Makey lights up, it's a conductor. If not, it's an insulator.

Make a list: Which objects conducted electricity? Which didn't?
